The Ruby on Rails framework uses YAML heavily for localization, configuration, and more, but you can tap into YAML files in your applications.

For my course [Hello Rails](https://hellorails.io) I used YAML to render almost all content on the marketing page you see when you visit the site. It didn't make much sense to host that data in a database, and it was way quicker to update and fine-tune over time.
